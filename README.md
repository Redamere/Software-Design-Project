COSC 4353: Group 46

## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for our COSC 4353 Software Design Project, developed by Group 46. The project focuses on building a web application using the MERN stack.

## MERN Stack

The MERN stack is a full-stack development framework that consists of four main technologies:

1. **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. MongoDB is well-suited for handling large amounts of unstructured data and is a popular choice for scalable applications.

2. **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, Express.js simplifies the process of building robust and scalable web applications. It provides a set of features for web and mobile applications, making it easier to develop RESTful APIs.

3. **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is used for creating dynamic and interactive front-end components. It allows developers to build reusable UI components and efficiently update the user interface as the data changes.

4. **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows the execution of JavaScript code on the server side. Node.js is used to build scalable network applications and is an essential component of the MERN stack.
